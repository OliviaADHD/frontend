Notes on how to log in with Google:
Possible other things: adding "scheme": "oliviaredirect" to the app.json
	1. in console: expo-auth-session expo-random
	2. details: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/authentication/#google
	3. need to create a config, followed the 'development in expo go app
		3.1 do expo login (create an accoutn if you don't have one)
		3.2 set up the google client ID as prescribed. You need to create a new project, and there you also specifiy the users accepted atm (atm only me). Then you need to create the credentials as described. Change the username + projectName in the authorized redirect URIS! (Well, otherwise you'll get an error screen on the first try, and by clicking on details it will tell you the correct URI)
